## task

This is our solution to the week 7 challenge at Makers Academy. We worked in a team of 3 to develop a front end only note taking application. 

Written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS, we have developed an app that can create notes, display them individually and have utilised an API to enable emoji creation.

Sticking to the theme of the week, Vanilla JavaScript, we also created our own testing framework in order to follow TDD principles.

## How to use

Enter the following into your command line to get using the noteApp.

```
git clone https://github.com/charlierdm/noteApp.git
```

```
open index.html
```

This will open your browser and allow you to create notes. They won't be erased when you leave the page as the app is designed to utilise your browsers storage.
